Pathfinding Visualization
-------------------------

Pathfinding visualizer built in Java using JavaFX library for GUI. Each cell on a grid has its color value which determines its purpose.

Colors
------

* White represents all available "path" cells
* Black represents wall cells
* Green represents start cell
* Red represents end cell
* Purple represents all the visited cells
* Yellow represents one of possibly more shortest paths

Description
-----------

For now this app allows user to choose between few implemented pathfinding algorithms like BFS (breadth-first search), DFS (depth first search) and Dijksra's algorithm.

Usage
-----

To select start point press "s" key and select cell, to select end point press "f", for deleting use "e" and for drawing walls use "d", select algorithm and press start
